This repository contains my final project for Computational Biology which involved creating a rudimentary, Markov Chain-based, protein folding prediction model. The last stage of the prediction model is plotted with a rotatable graph through the Plotly Python library, which can only be visualized by downloading the .html file.

This document is broken down into the following sections:
  I. Background Information
    i. Understanding the Structure of a Protein
    ii. Previous Attempts at Protein Prediction With Markov Chains
  II. Building the Markov Chain Model
    i. Building the First Model
    ii. Building the Second Markov Model
    ii. Building the Third Markov Model
  III. Conclusion/Final Thoughts
